Simple and Extendable ID Generator
==================================

This generator creates different patterns of ID for use when you need more than sequential Ids, and when a Guid does not fulfil your use cases.

What are the use cases that ispired me to create this generator
---------------------------------------------------------------

Initially, I got a project which some of the classes must have a first-look identifiable id. One of these classes must have a specific prefix, other classes
must have also a suffix.

Other projects needed some specific types of id, and I complemented the original generator with more use cases.

Feel free to contribute if you have a better implementation or a different use case not covered!
